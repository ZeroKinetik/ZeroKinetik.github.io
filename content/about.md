Junior undergraduate in Electronics and Computer Engineering at [Amrita School of Engineering](https://www.amrita.edu/school/engineering/amritapuri)

with a keen interest in distributed systems, API development and scalable architecture design. I've built a few [projects](https://github.com/ZeroKinetik) which intrigued and deepened my knowledge in development. My bachelor's thesis explores on optimization techniques for [graph compression]() in social networks.

I enjoy solving coding challengesâ€”having solved over 700+ problems on [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/users/zerokinetik). I'm an active open-source contributor through programs like the MLH Fellowship.

In the meantime, you'll find me sketching portraits, working on my creative writing, building a consistent reading habit, or enjoying a game of chess, badminton, or ping-pong.
